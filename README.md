# Gender Prediction Using Names
This project explores the prediction of a person's gender based on their name using Excel-based analysis. A test-validation approach was implemented, where 70% of the dataset (balanced by gender) was used for testing and 30% for validation. The analysis began with pivot-based insights, followed by an improved approach that considered the last two letters of names, increasing accuracy from 83% to 84%. The model's performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability. This project demonstrates the potential of simple yet effective data analysis techniques in predictive modeling without the need for complex machine learning tools.
