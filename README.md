# Gender-Prediction-Using-Names
This project predicts gender based on names using an Excel-driven approach. A 70%-30% test-validation split was applied with balanced gender representation. Initial pivot-based analysis improved by considering the last two letters of names, increasing accuracy from 83% to 84%. Performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
